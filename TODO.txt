TODO:

NEXT STEP:
position the camera in a better place and chop off the sides
	make it resizable (with the window)
	hide/show camera work
make show more comments work
have people's profiles reflect their comments and likes
search
hashtags

----P1-----
make the new user state (give them a stock 'egg' photo so their profile doesn't looks terrible)

turn off camera when you leave the "your profile" page

search by username and search by hashtag

email

taking a picture and then signing out doesn't update the global model
	a refresh doesn't even update the global model I don't think
	or maybe the directive isn't working entirely correclty...

order the pictures in the populate call by date
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5125521/uses-for-mongodb-objectid-creation-time

order the users by some way for the feed call

export as gif?

BUG: pictures don't start cycling on login - have to click on profile and then back to feed?
	or soemtiems it just stops entirely, but closing the tab and going back in fixes it
	i think this is a result of them not being cached

BUG: picture has like 10px of just transparency on bottom- so its not actually 640x640
	well it is but it has that fucked up transparency

BUG: profile/myusername shows you profile as if it's not yours

BUG: if their session expires on the backend (or the server goes down and back up) they don't get logged out because they still have their cookie
	if cookie is empty then erase the old cookie and null out currentUser


----P2-----
send down user object of current logged in user when you make the call to serve the pages
	store it in a cookie or something

pre-load all images
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14373683/how-to-show-image-only-when-it-is-completely-loaded

prompt to download plugin for safari/ie users (for camera)

find a way to tell the user to permanently accept the webrtc from our website
	https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/dayblXQVt1M
		if over https it can say "always"
	also you can do it manually but its a bitch

make the image slideshow only appear once you scroll to it
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487073/check-if-element-is-visible-after-scrolling

put in lines for eyes and middle of face (and a gray outline that shows how it will be saved)

button that toggles the overlay of the last image

tell the browswer to cache the images indefinitely
	https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching
	- also if cache is disabled, it barely works

change the speed of the facelapse
