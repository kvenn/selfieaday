AUTH/SESSION
	when log in you get a cookie with the user
		if you leave and come back and we see the cookie, we get the user - if there is no user, we send a 404 and delete the cookie
		if cookie and !user
	is logged in just relies on that cookie - if expired/non existent, you have to log in again
	every call that pertains to your user brings it back and sets it on the Auth singleton
